# pupil

pupil is a server that is made useful by how it uses the [morsel](https://www.github.com/krad/morsel) & [memento](https://www.github.com/krad/memento) libraries.

## Requirements

If building with memento support the following dependencies need to be installed.

  * libavcodec (57.107.100)
  * libavutil (55.78.100)

Both of the above packages are available in ffmpeg release 3.4.1

## Roadmap

 * In future releases, memento support should become a build time option, so the ffmpeg libs won't be a hard requirement.
 * Documentation explaining what this is.
 * Documentation explaining what everything else is.
 * More sanity checks and tests in the code.
